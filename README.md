# image-gallery

A web app where users can upload, save and view images. Users first create and name an 'album'. Images can be uploaded to an album to be viewed as well as deleted. Multiple albums can be created which allows users to be able to organize and group images.

This app was created with Uber's open source software called Fusion.js that uses React. I also used MongoDB for the database.
